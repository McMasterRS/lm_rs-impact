## Research Software and Research Impact

Open Scholarship, also known as open science, refers to the movement towards making research and scholarly work openly accessible, transparent and reusable. Open Scholarship encompasses different principles and practices aimed at promoting collaboration, transparency and the sharing of knowledge in the academic community. While research impact refers to the influence and effects that research activities have on various stakeholders, including academia, industry, policy-makers, society, and the broader public. Open scholarship expands the influence of research on the advancement of knowledge within academic disciplines. It is often measured through citations in peer-reviewed journels and the recognition of research within the scholarly community.  

One of the key components of open scholarship is open source software. Open-source software is software that the source code is freely available, allowing others to view, modify, and distribute the code. Open-source software often play a significant role in research software development.  

The learning module aims to demonstrate the interconnection between open-source research software and research impact while offering practical guidance on enhancing accessibility and maximizing academic impact.
