## Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier and assigned to a digital resource, such as an article, dataset, software, or other scholarly work. The DOI provides a persistent link to the resource, making it easily identifiable and locatable on the internet. DOIs are commonly used in academic and scientific publishing to ensure the permanence and ciability of research outputs. They serve as stable and permanent identifiers for digital content, enableing reliable linking, referencing and tracking of scholarly works.  

When accessing a digital object through a DOI link, the [DOI resolve system](https://www.doi.org/) redirects the accessor to the resource's current location. This capability ensures that even if the original location becomes inaccessible or changes, the users can still access the content using the DOI link. Each DOI is associated with metadata that provides essential information about the digital object, such as the authors, title, publication date, and publisher. This metadata also facilitates accurate and comprehensive citation and discovery of the content.  

The use of DOIs has become a standard practice in scholarly publishing and other digital content distribution platforms, promoting the permanence, reliability and accessibility of research outputs in publications and on the internet.

Open Data, Open Source Software, and Open Publication Access form the foundational pillars of Open Science. DOIs play a crucial role in enabling seamless retrieval and utilization of openly available data by software, while research papers can effortlessly reference the software and data employed in the research process. This facilitates greater understanding, verification of results, and data reuse for novel analyses by other researchers.
