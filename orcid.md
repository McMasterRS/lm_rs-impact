## ORCID ID

ORCID stands for Open Research and Contributor ID. It is another type of persistent identifier, like DOI. However, unlike the DOI, an ORCID ID is assigned to individual researchers and contributors. It serves as a digital identifier that distinguishes one research from another, regardless of name variations or affiliations, and links them to their scholarly and research activities.  

ORCID IDs play a crucial role in promoting transparency, recognition, and attribution in academic research. By using ORCID IDs, researchers can take ownership of their scholarly output, establish a clear identity in the academic community, and receive proper credit for their contributions.  

Furthermore, ORCID IDs enable automated and accurate author disambiguation, reducing the chances of misidentification and ensuring that researchers receive due recognition for their work. The adoption of ORCID IDs has become increasingly prevalent in the academic world, fostering collaboration, facilitating research assessment, and enhancing the reliability and integrity of scholarly communications.
